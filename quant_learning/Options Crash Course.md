## Key Ideas
1. It's an agreement
	- To **maybe** buy/sell
	- At a given **price**
	- At a specified **time**
2. A premium is paid
	- Seller requires a premium for the **flexibility** of the agreement

Example: Buying a house.
- Seller want's 500k for the dream house.
- What can buyers do to purchase this house?
	- Spot/Cash Transaction. Agree on terms on exchange money for goods.
	- Forward Contract. Buy the house in 1 year for 500k. Depending on future appreciation or depreciation, it's good for the buyer or seller respectively
	- Option Contract: Pay 20k now for the option to buy the house in 1 year for 500000

## Why would you use options?
1. Hedge risk.
	- Say you purchased 100 BHP shares today. How do you protect yourself against losses?
	- ![[Pasted image 20230529192628.png]]
	- Idea: neutral exposure
2. Speculation
	- Bet on market moves in direction or volatility.

## Contracts and Terms
- An option is like an insurance product. Insurance is like a put option. A home owner with home insurance has the right to sell the home to the insurance company in the future. However, **you are under no obligation to sell the property or asset to the insurer or seller**.

### Terms
1. Premium
2. Expiration Date. House insurance for 1 year? 2 years? 10 years?
3. Strike (Exercise Price). How much will the insurance holder receive if a certain event occurs. This determines the payoff structure.
4. Underlying. 
	- Insurers value the insurance contract depending on the event and the probability of the event occurring. **The contract's price is very linked to what we're trying to price it on**
5. Contract Type. 

## Example
Go to ASX options > company directory > BHP.

Each expiry date has an options chain (all the contracts that will expire on a particular date).

## Option Call vs Put
- Option call: Right to buy the underlying @ price @ time in future
![[Pasted image 20230529194905.png]]
- Put option: Right to sell @ price @ time in the future
## Trading - Buying and Selling Options

## Underlying and Contract Multiplier
- An underlying is a security / commodity to be bought or sold under the terms of the contract
- An Options Underlying:
	- Shares. Only some companies around the world offer options
	- Futures
		- Eg quarterly futures for things like grain, etc
		- But also just about anything
### Contract Multiplier
Purchasing options on exchange-traded products have a **specific quantity of underlying** per contract.
Shares are usually offered as 100 shares / option contract.
Indexes are usually less.
### Why have a contract multiplier?
![[Pasted image 20230529201146.png]]
By adjusting the number of shares in the underlying contract, a **contract size that is reasonable** for the exchange can be created. 

## Strike Price and Expiration Date
Strike/Exercise Price: Price at which the underlying will be delivered should the holder of an option choose to exercise his right to buy/sell.
Expiration Date or Expiry: Date on which the owner of an option must make final decision to buy, in case of a call, or sell in case of put.
![[Pasted image 20230529201929.png]]
The more you move out the expiration date, the more variability of values your underlying can take on.

## Option Premium
Demand and Supply: Price at which a willing buyer and seller transact an options contract.
2 components:
- **Premium = Intrinsic Value + Future Value**
### Intrinsic Value
Price now. Amount of value in optionality right now. As if you exercised option today.

### Time Value
![[Pasted image 20230529202502.png]]
As price volatility and uncertainty increases, the time value of the contract increases as well which means you would have to pay a higher premium for it.
